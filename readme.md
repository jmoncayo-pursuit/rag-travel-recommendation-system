# RAG Travel Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a travel recommendation system built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Tailwind CSS for styling. It leverages AI-powered search using pgvector for efficient vector retrieval to provide personalized travel recommendations.

This system is a learning project to explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and vector databases for recommendation engines.

## Features (Planned)

- AI-powered search for travel destinations based on user preferences.
- Vector similarity search using pgvector for relevant recommendations.
- REST API for backend logic and data retrieval.
- React frontend for user interface and displaying recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Vector Database:** pgvector
- **Embeddings:** [Choose an embedding model and mention it here - we'll decide this in the next steps]
- **AI Model (for potential response generation):** [Choose an AI model if you plan to add response generation - we'll decide this later]

## Setup Instructions (Initial - will be expanded)

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Node.js and npm installed
    - PostgreSQL installed (instructions to install pgvector extension are in progress - see development logs)
    - [Add any other prerequisites as you identify them, e.g., OpenAI API key if used later]

2. **Database Setup:**
    - PostgreSQL is required with the `pgvector` extension enabled. [Link to detailed instructions once finalized]

3. **Backend Setup:**
    - [Instructions for backend setup will be added as we develop it]

4. **Frontend Setup:**
    - [Instructions for frontend setup will be added as we develop it]

## Development Status

[Initially: "Database setup with pgvector is complete."]
